## Overview
This application stores information about candidates. It takes in a name, an acceptance status, and a date/time stamp. A name and an acceptance status are required fields, with the name being unique. A user can create a new candidate, update an existing one, find an existing one, and delete an existing one. Candidates are saved using MongoDB. See separate README.md files under back-end and front-end for set-up requirements.
